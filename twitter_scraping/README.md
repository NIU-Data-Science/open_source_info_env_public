# Twitter scraping to explore and evaluate historical twitter usage in a low resource country

These ipynb files will scrape twitter for several major regions in Niger and begin basic analysis and visualization.  Additional data on how to set up your python environment, prepare your data, and run the code blocks are provided as text blocks and comments in each ipynb file.  In this case, the data focuses on a sample case study of Niger.  

Some sample scrapes are included in this repository, but storage limitations have left some files zipped.
