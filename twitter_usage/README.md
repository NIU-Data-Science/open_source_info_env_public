files for importing data from archive.org and filtering, analyzing, and plotting relevant data

After downloading and unzipping the archive.org archived tweets, run the files in order, 1-4.  This will take a while.

Alternatively, you can skip ahead to the middle of the second file, where it loads the included pickle file that stores a large dataframe after all the initial processing.

Or, you can skip ahead to the third and fourth files and load the included bokeh pickle file to run the bokeh parts.
