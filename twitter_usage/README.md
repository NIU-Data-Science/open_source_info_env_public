# Twitter usage statistics and visualization 

Thes ipynb files are for importing data from archive.org and filtering, analyzing, and plotting relevant data.  Additional data on how to set up your python environment, prepare your data, and run the code blocks are provided as text blocks and comments in each ipynb file.  

Generally speaking, after downloading and unzipping the archive.org archived tweets, run the files in order, 1-4.  This will take a while.  

Alternatively, you can skip ahead to the middle of the second file, where it loads the included pickle file that stores a large dataframe after all the initial processing.  The pickle file is included but must be unzipped.

Or, you can skip ahead to the third and fourth files and load the included bokeh pickle file to run the bokeh parts.  Bokeh can be run in-line to the ipynb files for the initial plots, but for the final plots, Bokeh must be served.
